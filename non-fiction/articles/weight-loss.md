What's my goal?
* I want to tell other people about my experiences with weight loss to help them make better decisions and be better prepared for weight loss themselves.

What's the story of how I lost weight?
* I didn't tell my parents
* I started to pace
* I did a form of calorie counting
* I learned a few things along the way
    * One pound of fat is 3,500 Calories, so having a deficit of 500 Calories per day will lead to one pound of weight loss per day.
    * Food doesn't have to be healthy to lose weight, though being healthy is better, especially since I was eating less.
    * Pacing eating can allow losing weight during the holiday season.
    * Don't get discouraged when you don't see the weight going down.
    * As long as the weight isn't going up, you are succeeding. Make the weight go down occasionally and never go up and you will lose weight.
* I was successful at losing weight. Sometimes it was hard and other times it felt easy.

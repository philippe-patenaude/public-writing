## Basic ideas

* The story might take place in a Halloween fantasy town with a Transylvania style castle.
* The characters might be cat people.
* The main character might be a human.
* The main character's name might be Jon.
* He might have mysteriously been teleported to this town.
* The leader of the town might be a prince.
* His name might be McMeow.
* He may be crazy.
* He may accept to let the main character leave if the main character steals all the eggs from town.
* The other cat people from town won't let Jon steal the eggs.
* Jon has to decide whether to do what McMeow asked or to find another way to leave.
* Jon may make friends with the townspeople.
* Jon may decide he likes it in the town and doesn't want to leave.
* McMeow may have a guard.

## Title and blurb
Title plus blurb about the book. Also a blurb describing future writer me (this was part of a writing exercise; I'll just include it for completeness.)

Titles? Catptured, Lost in Catville, The Crazed Cat Prince, **Catptured by the Crazed Cat Prince of Catville**.

Blurb: Jon is a normal person who suddenly gets teleported to a Transylvanian cat person village. He finds himself trapped unless he can satisfy the demands of the crazed prince McMeow. Will he do as the prince asks or will he find a new way to get back to his previous life?

Bio: Philippe Patenaude is a late bloomer in the writing field. He worked his early career as a software developer before leaving the field for greater achievements. He built up a repertoire [future me comment: This is the wrong word to use] of books to become a favorite of young adults everywhere.

## An attempt at the climax scene
Jon is sad because he thinks he won't be able to go home, but all the townspeople come to help him. He then decides he doesn't want to leave.

"McMeow!" Jon cries. "There's no way that I can steal the eggs from your towncats." McMeow gives an evil laugh "Meow he he he ho ho ho haw". "If you can't do that, then I'll have to throw you in the dungeon!" As his guard comes to grab you, the doors to the castle throne room burst open. "Stop! Meow." It's Bill the baker! He's followed by Bessie, Tomtom, Cassie, Mittens, and the rest of the cat villagers! "He has made his choice. He doesn't need to go to the dungeon. He can live with me" said Bill. Bessie followed up with "and he can work in my shop".

## Alternate version of climax scene
"That's not the way I remember it. Jon, the naked foreigner, yells at my master 'You're a monster! I should slay you right here and now.' My master's eyes show fear. I won't let this beast say such cruel things of my master, so I pulled out my sword and stood before my master. "Then you shall go to the dungeon!" I reply. Jon stepped back. I bared my sword and walked towards Jon, but before I could tackle him, the doors to the throne room burst open. The cat people of the town stood there with pitch forks, butcher knives, sharpened sticks, and all sorts of weapons. Bill the baker yelled out "This is the end, McMeow!" Despite my fear, I stood strong. I won't let this coup go, even if I'm out numbered ten to one!

## 5 key points from the book
The scene where Jon arrives in the strange land and views it. There will be pretty landscapes, a castle, a small town, and the first distant view of cat people. (sights)

The scene where Jon gets captured and brought to the crazy prince McMeow. He is given the challenge to steal all the eggs in town. (sounds)

The scene where Jon tries to escape but continually fails to. (emotions; fear, depression, anger)

The scene where Jon meets a thief in the town. The thief helps him stay safe from the storm and teaches him about stealing and how to survive homeless. (smells and cat culture)

The scene where Jon tries to collect eggs. He collects them from several cat people before before getting caught by the baker. Jon feels guilty and the baker brings Jon in and helps him with food and shelter. (relief, guilt, repentance)

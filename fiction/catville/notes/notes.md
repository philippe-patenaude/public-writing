## Original free write
Thinking more about RPG ideas, the player could be dropped into a halloween Transylvanian type town run by cats. There could be cat witches and warriors and the town could be run by a crazy cat prince. They don't work well together and are always fighting with each other. You get captured by some guards and get lead to the cat prince. He then gives you a quest: "Steal all the eggs from this town and make me an egg banquet and I shall let you leave"! You get released from the castle, but find that there is no easy way to leave this town. You have to decide whether to do as he says or find another way to leave or decide to stay for the rest of your life. The inhabitants know of the prince's strange demands, so they aren't fazed by the. Some will help you, but most will not. You will have to learn to use the rifts between town's folk to get more eggs or make them like you so they help you escape or adopt you as one of their own. Town inhabitants: The royal guard, the witch, the prince, the cobbler, the shepard, the farmer, and others. (the mother, the father, the three children)

## Basic ideas

* The story might take place in a Halloween fantasy town with a Transylvania style castle.
* The characters might be cat people.
* The main character might be a human.
* The main character's name might be Jon.
* He might have mysteriously been teleported to this town.
* The leader of the town might be a prince.
* His name might be McMeow.
* He may be crazy.
* He may accept to let the main character leave if the main character steals all the eggs from town.
* The other cat people from town won't let Jon steal the eggs.
* Jon has to decide whether to do what McMeow asked or to find another way to leave.
* Jon may make friends with the townspeople.
* Jon may decide he likes it in the town and doesn't want to leave.
* McMeow may have a guard.

## Title and blurb
Title plus blurb about the book. Also a blurb describing future writer me (this was part of a writing exercise; I'll just include it for completeness.)

Titles? Catptured, Lost in Catville, The Crazed Cat Prince, **Catptured by the Crazed Cat Prince of Catville**.

Blurb: Jon is a normal person who suddenly gets teleported to a Transylvanian cat person village. He finds himself trapped unless he can satisfy the demands of the crazed prince McMeow. Will he do as the prince asks or will he find a new way to get back to his previous life?

Bio: Philippe Patenaude is a late bloomer in the writing field. He worked his early career as a software developer before leaving the field for greater achievements. He built up a repertoire [future me comment: This is the wrong word to use] of books to become a favorite of young adults everywhere.

## An attempt at the climax scene
Jon is sad because he thinks he won't be able to go home, but all the townspeople come to help him. He then decides he doesn't want to leave.

"McMeow!" Jon cries. "There's no way that I can steal the eggs from your towncats." McMeow gives an evil laugh "Meow he he he ho ho ho haw". "If you can't do that, then I'll have to throw you in the dungeon!" As his guard comes to grab you, the doors to the castle throne room burst open. "Stop! Meow." It's Bill the baker! He's followed by Bessie, Tomtom, Cassie, Mittens, and the rest of the cat villagers! "He has made his choice. He doesn't need to go to the dungeon. He can live with me" said Bill. Bessie followed up with "and he can work in my shop".

## Alternate version of climax scene
"That's not the way I remember it. Jon, the naked foreigner, yells at my master 'You're a monster! I should slay you right here and now.' My master's eyes show fear. I won't let this beast say such cruel things of my master, so I pulled out my sword and stood before my master. "Then you shall go to the dungeon!" I reply. Jon stepped back. I bared my sword and walked towards Jon, but before I could tackle him, the doors to the throne room burst open. The cat people of the town stood there with pitch forks, butcher knives, sharpened sticks, and all sorts of weapons. Bill the baker yelled out "This is the end, McMeow!" Despite my fear, I stood strong. I won't let this coup go, even if I'm out numbered ten to one!

## 5 key points from the book
The scene where Jon arrives in the strange land and views it. There will be pretty landscapes, a castle, a small town, and the first distant view of cat people. (sights)

The scene where Jon gets captured and brought to the crazy prince McMeow. He is given the challenge to steal all the eggs in town. (sounds)

The scene where Jon tries to escape but continually fails to. (emotions; fear, depression, anger)

The scene where Jon meets a thief in the town. The thief helps him stay safe from the storm and teaches him about stealing and how to survive homeless. (smells and cat culture)

The scene where Jon tries to collect eggs. He collects them from several cat people before before getting caught by the baker. Jon feels guilty and the baker brings Jon in and helps him with food and shelter. (relief, guilt, repentance)

## More key points from the book
The scenes where Jon meets the other villagers.
* Jon meets Smudge when Bandit asks Jon to go buy firewood from the lumberjack.
* Jon meets Bella when Bandit asks Jon to go get medicine from the apothecary.
* Jon meets Ivy when Bandit asks Jon to go trade bread for meat and furs.
* Jon gets turned away my Midnight (the inn keeper) for not having money and looking strange.
* Jon meets Athena when he goes to collect wheat (or other grains?) for Bandit.

## Characters
McMeow (real name: Rain): The crazy cat prince. He likes to give people near impossible tasks and watch as they struggle to accomplish his orders.
Moose: The cat prince's loyal royal guard.
Titan: A thief by trade. He is always looking for new ways to get away with stealing.
Bandit: "Bandit the baker" is his nickname. He is a really big cat and runs a bakery in town. He's trustworthy and kind. He has many friends.

Wise old man/women? Acts as a judge to mediate issues? Could come in at the end to ease the tension between the villagers and the prince. This character might come in sooner to help mediate other conflicts as well.

## Details to add
* What did Jon do for work before being teleported to this fantasy land?
* What do each of the cats look like? Should do research on types of cats and how they look.
* Do research on cat behavior/"culture" and add notes here.
* Do research on medieval towns; maybe some research into Transylvania? I should work on the castle and town description.
* How big is this town? Will Jon meet all the villagers or just some of them?
* One thing that I had in the original free write was that the town's cats are always fighting amongst themselves. I think that would add nice bits of content/story as Jon helps the villagers resolve their conflicts. What are the conflicts the villagers have?
* What are the names of the businesses the cats run?
* Are there stables and horses?
* I could add more details about the hiking scene. What does he see, hear, and feel? What are his emotions. Does he make any realizations during his internal dialogue?

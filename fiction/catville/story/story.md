## Part 1
Jon wakes up. He's feeling groggy. What happened? He had spent his life trying to climb the massive redwood tree of the business to get to the life bringing light at the top, but was never able to get out of the shady underbelly of the redwood.

Jon looks around. This isn't his bedroom. This isn't his office either. There are pine trees and he's laying on a rocky surface. He looks to the side and there's dark green moss glistening with morning dew. He smells the pine and decomposing leaves of the wilderness. He sits up. He feels the nausea. Maybe he got up too quick. What the heck happened last night? Jon can't remember.

Then something catches his eye in the distance. Is that a castle? He's never seen a castle in person before. "What" said Jon out loud in disbelief. It had tall pointy roofed spires and stood on a hill. He then noticed something below the castle.

There were roofs. He couldn't see the whole thing, but there appeared to be a town below the castle. Not only was it a town, but it looked medieval. "That's so strange" mumbled Jon. "I didn't know this place was in Maine" he thought out loud before a pause. "Am I in Maine?" He looks around at the mountains. "Nope" he replies to himself. The mountains surrounding this castle and town were tall and pointy. They had snow covered peaks, but it felt warm where he sat.

He stands up. "I'll go to that town and ask where I am" he says to himself. He takes a step and stumbles. He's still groggy. He gets near the town when he sees a strange resident walking down a dirt path towards the town. The resident appeared to be... very hairy. She had orange fur from head to toe. Jon could make out pointy ears on her head. She was wearing a light and loose shirt and no pants. She was walking upright on two feet, but the feet looked like paws. She had a long tail that was standing erect as she walked to the town.

"What the heck." thought Jon out loud. "I must be dreaming." He pinched the skin on his wrist. "Ouch! I guess I'm not dreaming. What the heck." Before he was caught by this strange creature, he decided to leave, so he crouched down and tiptoed back into the woods.

## Part 2
The sun was starting to set. "What am I going to do now?" asked Jon. As he wondered through the woods looking for shelter, it got really dark. "I guess I'll just have to sleep under the stars". But before he could settle down in the pine needles on the dirt of the forest floor, a light began to glow through the trees. It looks like it will be a full moon tonight.

Jon sits down on the pine needles. He sees the blinking of fireflies. The evening crickets are chirping from a nearby field. Then Jon hears a snapping branch. "Is there an animal nearby?" thinks Jon. He looks around, but all he can hear is his own breath. "Huh. Maybe it was just a branch falling down."

Jon relaxes then lays down. Then a small light caught his eye. He looked over and there are two shining eyes staring at him. Jon's hearts starts pounding viciously and any fatigue he had was gone. The eyes are coming closer.

Jon stumbles to his feet and starts to run. He hears the leaves and branches rustling and crunching behind him. The sound is getting closer very quickly. Too quickly. Jon takes a peek behind himself as he hears the heavy breathing of a beast.

The next thing he sees is a cat person brandishing a sword. The cat has black fur and two glowing eyes. He's wearing a tunic with a medieval insignia. Jon expected to be run through with the sword, but he was his own obstacle. Distracted by the glance back, Jon tripped over a stick and landed on the ground with a loud thud.

The next thing he knew, the cat person was on him and tying his hands with a rough thick rope.

<Jon gets brought to the castle. He gets presented to McMeow and gets the quest to steal all the eggs from the town.>

## Part 3
Jon is lead to the castle entrance. The guard stays behind as Jon steps down the stairs. "What am I to do? I don't really have to do as he says, do I?" Jon starts to hatch a plan. "I just need to get over those mountains. It will only take me a day." But then he realized that he didn't know if there were any villages around.

"Well, I'll just have to try. I should be able to see far from a mountain top." He looks around at the mountains. "Hmm. eeny meeny miny moe" he thinks out loud. "That one" he says. He's made his choice and wastes no time.

Six hours later, he is tired and hungry. His feet hurt, but the top of the mountain is so close! Before he know it, he reached an opening. "Finally!" he said in an exasperated tone. He looks out over the moonlit forest. There's no sign of any other settlements.

He feels his stomach sink. "Why did I climb this stupid mountain!" he says angrily. He sits down on the cold stone. The hiking was keeping him warm, but the night is getting cold and the wind bites at his face. "I better go down into the treeline before I freeze to death". He starts going back towards the village. He sees it down in the valley. Most of the lights are out, but there are a couple still burning.

He finds a ditch next to a rocky ledge that is protected from the wind. He lies down to sleep. He'll hike back down in the morning.

<He hikes back to the village>

## Part 4
Jon sits down behind a house. He leans on the white wall, hungry, sore, and demoralized. He stays there till midday. Then a shadow comes over him. "Dhere is a storm coming. Ya got a place ta go?" Jon looks up to see a white and tan cat. He's wearing an old dirty rugged shirt.

Jon replies "No". The cat gets a slight smile. "I'll take ya somewhere safe" he says. He pulls out an apple. "Have something to eat". Jon is starving so he takes the apple without question. He eats it in less than a minute. The cat smiles in amusement.

"Come this way" the cat says. Jon stands up shakily and follows the mysterious cat. He gets lead to an abandoned house just outside of town. The lawn is overgrown and hte walls are peeling. "I've got a mat over dhere you can sleep on" he says while pointing to a back room.

"Ya can rest for today, and I'll show you around tomorrow."

<He gets shown around town and taught how to steal to survive. The cat thief wants to use him for something (what is that something?)>

## Part 5
This time, it's going to be Jon's turn. He puts on his black cape and heads for town. It is a cloudy night, so the moon is hiding behind the clouds. Jon walks past a couple of cats walking back to their home. They are talking loudly to each other; they must be a little drunk.

He finds the empty house. The old cat Eric won't be back home for another couple of hours. Now is the chance to get those eggs. Jon makes sure there's nobody around before sneaking around the house. He finds the partially open window and opens it up the rest of the way with a loud screech. Jon hopes no neighbors took notice.

Jon climbs through the window. He quickly searches around the house for eggs. He finds the kitchen in the next room. He searches through the cabinets and finds six eggs. He can't fnd anymore, so he leaves through the window and heads for his next victim.

He goes to the bakery. There's bound to be a lot of eggs here! He looks around for an opening. He finds a hidden key under the back entry mat. That was too easy! He struggles to get the key into the lock, but he finally manages to unlock it with a clang. He gently pushes the door open. It squeaks loudly. "Yikes!" Jon whispers to himself.

Despite his worry, he steps in to find the eggs. He searches for a food pantry. He opens a door. Behind the door lay a dark corridor. Jon couldn't see anything within. "Well, I with I had a light" Jon whispers. "IT's not so dark during the day" says a loud deep voice from behind Jon. Jon jumps and his heart is racing fast. He spins around quickly and trips.

He falls into the corridor. He looks up to see a silhouette ofa large cat. This is the largest cat he's seen yet. The cat leans forward and says "what are you looking for in there?" Jon is frozen in fear. "Ah. Um. Uh." Jon stumbles over his words.

"I heard about what the prince asked you to do. You don't need to listen to him." Jon lays there quietly. "Have you been living on the street till now?" asked the cat. Jon nodes. "I can give you a place to stay and some food to eat if you'll do some work for me" he says. Jon can't believe the offer. "Um... what kind of work?" asks Jon.

"Nothing difficult. You can wash the dishes and carry firewood." "I... should be able to do that" "Hood! Let's get you on your feet" says the cat. After helping Jon up, he continues "my name is Bill. People call me Bill the baker." "I'm...Jon....Just Jon."

"Let's get you into bed. You look tired" he said. "Right this way" he says while leading Jon up a staircase to a bedroom on hte second floor. He gestures towards a mat on the floor.

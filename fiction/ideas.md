## Fully formed ideas

This is an idea that Brittany and I had some years ago, but I just remembered it. When reading through online recipes, they tend to be full of useless information that everybody skips to get to the actual recipe. As a fun website idea, Brittany and I had come up with the idea that we could have "personalities" writing the recipes. I imagine an Anime/Manga style portrait of men being sexy (shirtless with six pack abs and wearing an apron, that sort of thing). The article for the recipe will be full of sexual innuendo with different "authors" (the personalities) having different styles. I think this could be fun to write and it could be quite funny too. I would make everything very exaggerated like garnishing the meal at the end with rose petals and suggesting a candlelit table with a tablecloth that has hearts on it, that sort of thing.
